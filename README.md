Tech specs &amp; documents management system used in Narrow fabric textile factory

This program was written in 2005 when I worked in a textile company as a textile technician. I wrote this program to manage textile tech specifications and related tech documents. It used Java core,Swing,JDBC etc.

In order to run this program and get the snapshot,I have to comment out the database connection. The textile company I worked for has been now closed. The database is lost. I keep the programe only, not the database.
